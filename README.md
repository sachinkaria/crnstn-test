To Do:

- Refactor components in Beer Item and Home page into smaller reusable components e.g <Title/>
- Add sorting Beer list to redux store or route parameters rather than just component state to cache the sorting
- Ideally a TDD exercise with more time however would integrate testing to test redux actions and store as well as individual components
- Implement Styled components library
